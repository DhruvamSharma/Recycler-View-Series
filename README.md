# Recycler-View-Series

This article is a part of the recyclerview series that I started and this repository will form the basis for the last 2 part left, ie, part 5 and part 6. Hope you all enjoyed this series and I was able to point a direction in the case of RecyclerView in Android.  

In this part I try to help with Item Decorations in RecyclerViews and how to master them. These parts like the others will be as easy to understand and implement. With visual help ofcourse! Happy reading :)
